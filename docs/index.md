# Welcome to health-patterns

health-patterns is a collection of documentation and reference implementations that highlight how to combine various technologies into meaningful patterns for healthcare.

Below are the initial patterns that incorporate parts of Alvearie (https://alvearie.github.io/) and are used to start building your own healthcare solutions using a common base of technology.
### 1) Clinical Data Ingestion 
### 2) Clinical Data Enrichment  
#### 3) Clinical Data Analytics (not yet started)
